 🔍 Logistic Regression – Binary Classification Model

Welcome to this project that demonstrates the power and simplicity of **Logistic Regression**, one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning for **binary classification** tasks.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project walks through the complete pipeline of applying **Logistic Regression** on a real-world dataset. From **data preprocessing** to **model evaluation**, everything is covered in a beginner-friendly yet practical way.

Whether you're trying to predict if an email is spam, if a customer will churn, or if a transaction is fraudulent — logistic regression is often the first algorithm you’ll want to try.
